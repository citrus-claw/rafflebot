## 1. Title Card (0:00–0:05)

> RaffleBot. Provably fair, on-chain raffles — powered by AI.

---

## 2. CLI Demo (0:05–0:25)

> With RaffleBot's CLI, creating a raffle takes a single command. Set your prize, ticket price in USDC, and duration — and it's live on Solana in seconds. You can list active raffles, check ticket sales, and trigger winner draws — all from the terminal.

---

## 3. Web UI Walkthrough (0:25–0:55)

> The web app gives your users a front-row seat. Browse live raffles, buy tickets with one click, and watch the countdown to each draw. When time's up, Switchboard's on-demand VRF generates the winning ticket — verifiable randomness anyone can audit on-chain. Behind the scenes, an AI agent manages the entire lifecycle: creating raffles, monitoring entries, and executing draws autonomously.

---

## 4. Future Roadmap (0:55–1:10)

> What's next? Auto-payouts, a mobile app, and public APIs for third-party integrations. The big play: sponsored raffles — where brands fund prizes and get verified, on-chain engagement metrics. A new advertising primitive for Web3 and Web2 alike.

## 5. End Card (1:10–1:15)
